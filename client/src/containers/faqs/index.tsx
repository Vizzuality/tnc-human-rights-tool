                  How does this Toolset relate to other TNC and non-TNC human rights, equity, and
                  IPLC guidance?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  There is a chart of linked materials in Section 1 of this Toolset. Generally
                  speaking, the VCA Framework describes the what, while the Human Rights Guide and
                  this Toolset describe the how. All of TNC’s work with IPLC’s is predicated on
                  respect for human rights and self-determination, and these tools and guides exist
                  to ensure practitioners have a means to identify, understand, and practically
                  action those understandings at a detailed level.

                <h2>Don’t IPLCs need to participate in the screening themselves?</h2>
                <p>
                  As discussed in detail in the Introduction and Overview, it would be burdensome to
                  ask IPLCs to perform the high level of labor required in checking TNC proposals
                  and assumptions at the initial stage. Validating our assumptions with IPLCs,
                  however, is an important part of the later stages of this work.

                <h2>Why are teams doing this analysis themselves instead of hiring an expert?</h2>
                <p>
                  There are some instances where retaining expert help might achieve strongest
                  results, such as supporting teams in the Rightsholder Engagement process.

                <p>
                  In general, though, it’s preferable to have field teams do this work instead of
                  external experts for several reasons:

                    Trust. Field teams often have higher existing levels of trust with Communities,
                    meaning greater access to high-quality information. TNC projects often emerge
                    from existing relationships with Communities in regions where TNC has worked for
                    years. If the opposite is the case, and TNC is new to an environment where an
                    existing expert has stronger trust relationships, the external expert might be
                    the best choice.

                    Training. Running the screening is good training for field teams and their
                    future outcomes. A team that has worked together with IPLCs to understand and
                    apply unfamiliar human rights concepts in complex contexts will be best prepared
                    to spot new issues as they emerge.

                    Efficiency. In-house human resources are often more efficient from a time and
                    money perspective. Sometimes sophisticated analysis of experts is called for,
                    but generally, familiarity with the case is more important.{" "}

                    Ideally, conduct this screening as part of a Consultation Plan for FPIC, after

                    If human rights concerns emerge in the context of an ongoing project, this can
                    help teams in both responding to the immediate issue and taking steps to
                    proactively address human rights risks in future.

                <h2>
                  What if the project only has a small NCS component? Do we apply the Toolset just
                  to that component?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Even if NCS is only a small part of the project, it is worthwhile to address the
                  Toolset to the project as a whole since key audiences will unlikely make this kind
                  of distinction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That said, speed and agility are important in implementation of the NCS, and the
                  application of the Toolset must not become burdensome. Accordingly, the Toolset
                  was designed to be streamlined and easily integrated. It also rarely results in a
                  hold status or strict deadlines; it is meant rather to identify issues so teams
                  can move forward on addressing them along with their implementation plans.

                <h2>Are there possible negative consequences to running this screening?</h2>
                <p>
                  Teams who are concerned that this screening will highlight issues they cannot
                  afford to deal with all at once should remember that the screening generates
                  prioritized lists of issues to focus on. The “Escalate” recommendation to put
                  activities on hold only applies to new projects. For existing projects, the
                  recommendation is higher-level review, and this is reserved for risks of severe
                  human rights abuses. Most issues are placed on the Prioritize List or Watch List,
                  and invite teams to work quickly while honoring their capacity, time, and resource
                  constraints. The Toolset does not recommend stopping ongoing projects, and the
                  hope is that it provides an extra foundation for requests for funding and other
                  assistance for project teams.

                  Isn’t it the government’s job to promote human rights and TNC’s job to follow the

                <p>
                  This is an out-of-date understanding of human rights obligations. The human rights
                  treaties and obligations signed by States form the normative and moral framework
                  for citizen and institutional obligations that run independent of State
                  obligations. We all have a codified responsibility to uphold human rights. For
                  independent and private sector actors, it is a “responsibility to respect” human
                  rights, which differs subtly from the State’s “duty to protect” them.
