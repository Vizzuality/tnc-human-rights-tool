        Conservation or community development projects likely will create changes and impacts in the
        Communities they serve.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s important to understand that some degree of impact will be unavoidable, especially when
        considering potential impacts to socioeconomic rights such as access to food and water,
        level of income, and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        These rights are legally binding but also not typically considered to be justiciable —
        meaning subject to trial in a court of laws. Rather, the rights are understood to express
        the obligation of{" "}
        <Link href="/glossary#progressive-realization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          progressive realization
        </Link>
        , wherein States are required to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Respect existing access</li>
        <li>Protect from third-party interference</li>
        <li>
          Fulfill the right over time pursuant to concrete and non-discriminatory plans of action.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Some violations of socioeconomic rights are so severe or intertwined with other human rights
        violations that they are considered justiciable. To figure out which risks these are, draw
        on the concept of the <b>minimum core</b>, which refers to the basic level of a right that
        all humans are entitled to.
      </p>

      <p>
        In considering such violations, the focus is on the conduct that led to violation{" "}
        <i>(e.g.: Was the violation motivated by unlawful purpose?)</i> rather than the degree of
        the violation, the adequacy of the right alone or the condition of the right. Human rights
        law generally finds a minimum violation where the following factors are involved:
      </p>

      <ol className="list-[lower-alpha]">
        <li>unlawful discrimination in the respect, protection, or fulfillment of the right</li>
        <li>retrogressive actions or measures that worsen baseline conditions of the right</li>
        <li>
          failure to pursue available mitigation strategies that would alleviate insecurity, even in
          part
        </li>
        <li>the existence of persistent severe inadequacy, especially affecting children</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        If harm is driven by{" "}
        <Link href="/glossary#unlawful-discrimination" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          unlawful discrimination
        </Link>
        , violations may become entrenched and thus, harder to address. Furthermore, States’ claims
        that they lack means to address socioeconomic rights impacts does not absolve them of the
        responsibility to develop such measures.
      </p>

      <p>
        The concept of <b>minimum adequacy</b> is complicated. Minimum core analysis recognizes this
        limitation, but also presumes that there is a minimum core level of enjoyment of the right
        that all people need to live with basic dignity. Project risk assessment examines minimum
        core risks because an unintended consequence in the context of such a risk raises the
        possibility of more severe harm. For example, if a Community relies on a particular food
        source and experiences hunger when crops fail, any project that jeopardizes the viability of
        that food source might create a persistent state of hunger and raise the minimum core risk
        of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some <b>adequacy indicators</b> are provided below for six socioeconomic rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Human rights authorities have made clear that States’ claims about lack of resources to
        protect these rights must distinguish [between] inability [and] unwillingness, and can only
        be legitimate where a State can show it unsuccessfully sought to obtain international
        support. Many of these adequacy indicators also implicate the basic right to life.
      </p>

      <h3>Food</h3>
      <p>
        Food in a quantity and quality sufficient to satisfy the dietary needs of individuals, free
        from adverse substances, and acceptable within a given culture<sup>[1]</sup>. “The right to
        be free from hunger” is emphasized in article 11 of the ICESCR.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        [1] - See Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No. 12 (right
        to food) (relevant terms discussed at paragraphs 9-11).
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Water</h3>
      <p>
        Clean water to meet the needs of “drinking, personal sanitation, washing of clothes, food
        preparation, personal and household hygiene” is necessary to prevent disease.<sup>[1]</sup>{" "}
        The right to water is a component of adequate standards of living according to article 11 of
        the ICESCR.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        [1] - See Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No. 15 (right
        to water) (additional minimum core elements discussed at paragraph 37).
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Housing</h3>
      <p>
        Shelter “providing the inhabitants with adequate space and protecting them from cold, damp,
        heat, rain, wind or other threats to health, structural hazards, and disease vectors. The
        physical safety of occupants must be guaranteed as well.”<sup>[1]</sup> The right to housing
        is a component of adequate standards of living in article 11 of the ICESCR.
      </p>

        [1] - See Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No. 4, ¶ 8
        (right to housing) (additional minimum core elements discussed at paragraph 8); General
        Comment No. 7 (regarding forced evictions).
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Medical care</h3>
      <p>
        The right to “the highest attainable standard of health” is stated in article 12 or the
        ICESCR.<sup>[1]</sup> The right includes freedom to control one’s and body, including sexual
        and reproductive freedom, the right to be free from non-consensual medical treatment and
        experimentation, as well as a protection component (“the right to a system of health
        protection which provides equality of opportunity”).<sup>[2]</sup> The protection component
        includes a right of access to “essential medicines,” especially vaccines for children.
        <sup>[3]</sup> Analysis should focus on health system failures that “are likely to result in
        bodily harm, unnecessary morbidity and preventable mortality.”<sup>[4]</sup>

      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>
        The right to education is stated in article 13 of the ICESCR and articles 28-29 of the
        Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). Education is linked to dignity: “a person’s
        basic right to acquire knowledge, culture, value and skills . . . are all intertwined and
        all constitute conditions for a life with human dignity.”<sup>[1]</sup> A focus on the
        availability of universal and free primary education includes freedom from discrimination in
        the area of education.

        This is the most recently codified right by most authorities, including the UN General
        Assembly, the Human Rights Council, and the European, Inter-American, and African regional
        human rights systems.<sup>[1]</sup> The Inter-American Court, in a contested legal case,
        found the right to be applicable in the nature of a due diligence obligation, requiring the
        duty-bearer to “(i) regulate; (ii) supervise and monitor; (iii) require and approve
        environmental impact assessments; (iv) establish contingency plans, and (v) mitigate, when
        environmental damage has occurred.”<sup>[2]</sup>

        There is, as yet, no specific guidance about the minimum core of the environment right,
        though authorities suggest it maps onto the elements of prohibiting unlawful discrimination,
        retrogression, and failure to pursue mitigation.
      </p>

      <p>
        If environmental harm strongly affects children, vulnerable groups, Indigenous Peoples,
        environmental defenders, or involves the use of toxic substances, a minimum core violation
        is more likely to be triggered.
      </p>

      <p>
        States have a clear obligation to meet these rights, but other entities — companies, NGOs —
        also have obligations. The{" "}

        UDHR and the ICESCR.
      </p>
      <p>
        The State’s obligations are generally more rigorously applied than a private actor’s, in
        that State’s authority is stronger and thus they have a clearer mandate to respect, protect,
        and fulfill as described above. The private actor’s authority in these aspects is understood
        to include any practical leverage they might use to achieve desirable results.

        When the Screening Tool indicates a <b>Minimum Core Risk Determination</b>, teams should
        apply factors (a)-(d) above, and review the relevant adequacy indicators to determine
        likelihood of a minimum core risk.
      </p>

      <p>
        Teams might simultaneously conduct a Project Risk Determination, because where minimum core
        risks exist, there will be situations where the risk is either <b>not applicable</b>,{" "}
        <b>unlikely</b>, the subject of <b>reliable mitigation</b>, <b>authorized</b>, or of{" "}
