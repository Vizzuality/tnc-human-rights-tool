                This Toolset is not meant to be a single solution to address human rights and
                conservation work. It aims to be a preliminary process to identify issues and
                perform early due diligence in advance of other work — organizing project decisions
                around IPLC self-determination, designing mitigation strategies, and project
                implementation.
              </p>

              <p>
                These challenges might be addressed by other tools, some of which are compiled

                <p>
                  TNC’s core guidance on how to pursue ambitious conservation agendas with full
                  respect for human rights and IPLC self-determination. This Toolset should be
                  considered one component of the larger vision in the Human Rights Guide, and as
                  such it points repeatedly to corresponding Human Rights Guide Modules.

                  The VCA Framework Guide provides the most up-to-date vision of what TNC’s vision
                  of human rights-based conservation in partnership with IPLCs is. The most recent
                  version was launched in May 2022.

                <h3>Guidance for Integrating Gender Equity in Conservation</h3>
                <p>
                  This helps teams to locate their project’s level of opportunity and ambition on a
                  Gender Integration Continuum in order to select issues, checklists, exercises, and
                  tips to get started with integration of gender equity. TNC also has regional
                  gender communities of practice in Asia-Pacific Rim, Africa, and Latin America.

                <h4>SERVIR Gender Analysis Tool</h4>
                <p>
                  Gender analysis is a framework by which an activity can be assessed in the context
                  of gendered power dynamics, opportunities, and constraints. This can help teams
                  make recommendations for service design with an eye toward gender equity and
                  social inclusion. The SERVIR tool helps provide specific guidance and analysis to
                  help all genders realize equal benefits from the work being done.

                <h3>Conservation by Design (CbD) 2.0</h3>
                <p>
                  An older articulation of ideas first outlined in 1996, CbD was where TNC began to
                  articulate its vision of people-centered environmental conservation. It has shaped
                  countless TNC projects and helps situate conservation ambitions within complex
                  social and environmental realities, both globally and locally.
