                This Toolset is not meant to be a single solution to address human rights and
                conservation work. It aims to be a preliminary process to identify issues and
                perform early due diligence in advance of other work — organizing project decisions
                around IPLC self-determination, designing mitigation strategies, and project
                implementation.
              </p>

              <p>
                These challenges might be addressed by other tools, some of which are compiled

                    This helps teams to locate their project’s level of opportunity and ambition on
                    a Gender Integration Continuum in order to select issues, checklists, exercises,
                    and tips to get started with integration of gender equity. TNC also has regional
                    gender communities of practice in Asia-Pacific Rim, Africa, and Latin America.

                  <p>
                    An older articulation of ideas first outlined in 1996, CbD was where TNC began
                    to articulate its vision of people-centered environmental conservation. It has
                    shaped countless TNC projects and helps situate conservation ambitions within
                    complex social and environmental realities, both globally and locally.
