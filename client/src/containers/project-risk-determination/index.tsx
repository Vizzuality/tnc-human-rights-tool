      <h1>The Project Risk Determination</h1>

      <p>
        The Project Risk Determination template helps teams make decisions by asking whether the
        nature and extent of a given risk is such that it might be considered a manageable or normal
        part of work in the environment. These risks are placed on the Watch List, while risks not
        classifiable as normal are placed on the Prioritize List or Escalate List.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Project Risk Determination first examines the relationships between a project and
        potential human rights impacts which encompass a spectrum of linkages from direct causation,
        exacerbating, to tolerating human rights impacts. Teams are responsible for examining the
        full range of the spectrum and future actions will be prioritized by the human rights
        screening tool framework. Teams will be asked to apply the template for each individual risk
        submitted to the Project Risk Screen.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        *NOTE: It is important to consider the situation from an external point of view as well, and
        to flag risks in situations where others might perceive a risk to exist even if the internal
        team is thoroughly convinced there is no risk.
      </blockquote>

      <p>Teams can use the mnemonic NAURMAL to remember the template elements:</p>

      <p>To delve into each element a bit more:</p>

      <div id="not-aplicable">
        <h3>Not Applicable</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes risks are not applicable for categorical reasons. For example, there are
          widespread killings of a persecuted minority in the region, but no members of the minority
          or their antagonists live in the village where TNC will be working.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          NOTE: Project work can change existing dynamics. For example, if the project brings
          resources into the village, the hypothetical minority or antagonists might flock there.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Teams should be careful before deciding that a risk is not applicable because the project
          is not a cause of the risk. Human rights due diligence requires a broader analysis: not
          just whether the project <strong>caused</strong> the risk, but also whether it could{" "}
          <strong>contribute</strong> to the risk or be <strong>directly linked</strong> to it, as
          in the hypothetical scenario of TNC working with a contractor who refuses to address
          unsafe work conditions. The relationships between a project and potential human rights
          impacts encompass a spectrum of linkages from direct causation, exacerbating, to
          tolerating human rights impacts. Teams are responsible for examining the full range of the
          spectrum and future actions will be prioritized by the human rights screening tool
          framework.{" "}

          addresses these concepts further.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where TNC is <strong>linked</strong> to an impact, TNC has an obligation to use any
          leverage it has to mitigate harm in proportion to how closely it is linked. Yet even where
          the link is distant, if TNC can exercise leverage to make a difference, there may be an
          obligation to do so.

        <h3>Unlikely</h3>
        <p>
          This element asks teams to think creatively about how events might unfold in the future.
          To do this well, teams should have a good understanding of working environments elsewhere,
          along with underlying pressures and incentives. Teams make a judgment call and validate it
          with Communities at a later phase.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Example: A team has captured project-site photos and videos featuring Community members
          and has obtained permission from community leaders and individuals to use the images could
          state that it is unlikely that the project will impact cultural rights from the use of
          images.

            To be <strong>Reliable</strong>, a strategy should not be speculative, but a realistic

      <div id="limited">
        <h3>Limited</h3>
        <p>
          Teams need to be careful with this element. Put bluntly, this element asks whether the
          risk is lower in importance given factors of <strong>severity</strong> (how traumatic or
          unacceptable the harm is), <strong>scope</strong> (number of people involved), and{" "}
          <strong>redressability</strong> (how easy it would be to remediate the harm). This{" "}

            Explanatory Note

          illuminates these concepts further.
        </p>

        <p>
          These factors are subjective. Even if the risk only affects a few people, it will not feel
          limited to them. And there will often be disagreement about redressability, especially
          from communities who want to see risks avoided, not caused and then remediated. Teams
          should therefore only rely on this factor in clear-cut cases.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          Example: The risk of destruction of an Indigenous burial ground may be seen as a severe
          harm to cultural rights that can’t be undone. By contrast, construction leading to
          sedimentation of a portion of a sacred ancestral riverbed might be seen as more limited
          risk because the impact is less severe, has a limited effect on downstream users, and
          could be remediated. But a Community might feel that damage to a sacred ancestral riverbed
          is a harm that can never be undone, and intensive remediation techniques like dredging
          could just exacerbate the harm.
        </blockquote>

      <p>
        These determinations rely mostly on subjective judgment calls, so it can be helpful to place
        risk along a continuum from high to low. High risks would not meet the NAURMAL criteria,
        whereas low risks would. Teams can use this continuum to score risks for placement on each
        of the Lists — Escalate, Priority, and Watch.
